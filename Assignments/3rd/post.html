      <h3>News</h3>
      <p>
        More than two years ago, Microsoft announced it would rename its Office 365 SMB offerings as “Microsoft 365.”
        Today the company made the name change for all of its productivity apps.
        Included in the Microsoft 365 name change is Office.com, the Office mobile app, and the Office app for Windows.
        Each will have with a new icon, a new look, and “even more features," a company FAQ explained.
        Microsoft 365 is a cloud platform that includes apps like Microsoft Teams, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and
        OneDrive.
        The official name change for Office will take place in November, meaning users who access the apps via
        Office.com will automatically be switched to Microsoft365.com. The same changes will begin rolling out for the
        Office app for Windows, macOS, iOS, and Android in January 2023.
        Along with a new logo, Microsoft said it’s adding new types of content creation methods and templates, either
        blank templates or recommended templates, according to a company blog post.
        Microsoft’s Create module is already available to all users on the web, Windows, and mobile devices, but it will
        be offering more template types next year. The company did not specify what new templates would be available to
        users.
        Additionally, beginning next month there will be a new Apps module what will allow users to discover, launch,
        and pin tools they use the most across Microsoft 365. The same capability to pin tools will be available on
        Microsoft 365 mobile in the coming months.
        Next month, badging will allow consumer users on the web and Windows to see their Microsoft 365 subscription
        status and track storage usage in one place.
        A feature that allows business users to centrally store and view content, called My Content, will now also be
        available for all web and Windows use beginning in November.
        Lastly, Microsoft will be offering Tagging as a new method to group and organize content with custom tags. The
        feature is available today for commercial users on the web and Windows.

      <h3>Python</h3>
      <p>
        Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability
        with the use of significant indentation.

        Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including
        structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described as a
        "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.

        Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC programming language and
        first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0. Python 2.0 was released in 2000 and introduced new features such
        as list comprehensions, cycle-detecting garbage collection, reference counting, and Unicode support. Python 3.0,
        released in 2008, was a major revision that is not completely backward-compatible with earlier versions. Python
        2 was discontinued with version 2.7.18 in 2020.

        Python consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming languages.

      <h3>AI</h3>
      <p>
        Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines, as opposed to the natural intelligence
        displayed by animals and humans. AI research has been defined as the field of study of intelligent agents, which
        refers to any system that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of achieving its
        goals.

        The term "artificial intelligence" had previously been used to describe machines that mimic and display "human"
        cognitive skills that are associated with the human mind, such as "learning" and "problem-solving". This
        definition has since been rejected by major AI researchers who now describe AI in terms of rationality and
        acting rationally, which does not limit how intelligence can be articulated.

        AI applications include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google), recommendation systems (used by YouTube,
        Amazon and Netflix), understanding human speech (such as Siri and Alexa), self-driving cars (e.g., Tesla),
        automated decision-making and competing at the highest level in strategic game systems (such as chess and
        Go). As machines become increasingly capable, tasks considered to require "intelligence" are often removed
        from the definition of AI, a phenomenon known as the AI effect. For instance, optical character recognition
        is frequently excluded from things considered to be AI, having become a routine technology.

      <h3>Front End</h3>
      <p>
        Front-end web development, also known as client-side development is the practice of producing HTML, CSS and
        JavaScript for a website or Web Application so that a user can see and interact with them directly. The
        challenge associated with front end development is that the tools and techniques used to create the front end of
        a website change constantly and so the developer needs to constantly be aware of how the field is developing.
        The objective of designing a site is to ensure that when the users open up the site they see the information in
        a format that is easy to read and relevant. This is further complicated by the fact that users now use a large
        variety of devices with varying screen sizes and resolutions thus forcing the designer to take into
        consideration these aspects when designing the site. They need to ensure that their site comes up correctly in
        different browsers (cross-browser), different operating systems (cross-platform) and different devices
        (cross-device), which requires careful planning on the side of the developer.
